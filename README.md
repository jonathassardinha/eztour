## Pains we want to solve

1. The modal's positioning
2. Multi-level focus
3. Highlighting untraditional elements (non-square, non-circle)
4. Styling is weird and overcomplicated
5. Managing interactivity with the page during tours
6. (nice-to-have) Hot-reload

## Pains or improvements we do not care about

1. Animation between steps
